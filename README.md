# webservices-bench
Project to test and compare different webservices

## Synopsis
I have been asked my wishes for the technical base components by the company in which I am working.

Apart from my wishes, the structural proposals were :
 - switch from Thrift services to REST services
 - switch from Tomcat/Guice to Tomcat/spring-boot
 - switch from Ant/Ivy to Maven

This project aims to test these solutions on server side.

## Maven
When I began my integration tests, I began to write the pom.xml. I found it too complex and too verbose.

So I decided to test Gradle which is almost perfect from my point of view.
